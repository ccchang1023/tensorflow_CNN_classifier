# Tensorflow CNN image classifier</br>
A simple practice to apply CNN on images recognition (cats, dogs and flowers)

The code structure is based on MorvanZhou tutorials
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSDrJM6fJFM&index=19&list=PLXO45tsB95cJHXaDKpbwr5fC_CCYylw1f)

Used 2 conv layers, 2 relu layers, 2 max pool layers, 1 fc and 1 dropout layers.

Images are download from Kaggle:Dogsvs.Cats(https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)
and University of Oxford,Flower Species Recognition(http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/index.html)

Labels: 0->cat, 1->dog, 2->flower

After 3000 training iterations, about 75% accuracy over 300 cats,dogs and flowers images
